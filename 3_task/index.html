      <em>(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)</em>

      <br />
      <div>
        To be, or not to be, that is the question:
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        Must give us pause—there's the respect
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        That makes calamity of so long life.
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        The insolence of office, and the spurns
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        When he himself might his quietus make
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        But that the dread of something after death,
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
        <br />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
